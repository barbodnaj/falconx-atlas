For production deployments, it‚Äôs strongly recommended to use unique credentials and not rely on defaults.

#### For remote servers

- You need to update every env variable starting with `PUBLIC_`.

- Open ports if necessary: make sure to open `PUBLIC_API_URL`, `PUBLIC_FRONT_URL` ports numbers by default
  8080, and 3000. Same for `PUBLIC_MINIO_ENDPOINT` port 9000 if you use Minio.
- Make sure the backend and frontend use the same protocol: https or http

### Run

Download this [docker-compose.yml file](./docker-compose.yml). At this point you should have 2 files `.env` and
`docker-compose.yml`.
Now run

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

Go to http://localhost:3000 or your custom `PUBLIC_FRONT_URL`

Celebrate on how easy this was

### Mobile app

You can use the [live Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atlas.cmms) and configure it with
your custom backend server url
